**Fossil Record** is the international, peer-reviewed palaeontological journal of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin. This journal was founded in 1998 under the name Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe and appears with two issues each year. It publishes original papers in all areas of palaeontology including the taxonomy and systematics of fossil organisms, biostratigraphy, palaeoecology, and evolution. All taxonomic groups are treated, including invertebrates, microfossils, plants, and vertebrates. Fossil Record publishes specimen-based research if the results are placed in a wider context or analysis and particularly encourages publication of studies applying analytical methods in the field of palaeobiology. With the above objective, Fossil Record covers the following fields:

* taxonomy and biodiversity;
* evolutionary (palaeo-)biology;
* changes in taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity;
* phylogeny;
* evolution and development;
* biogeochemistry;
* biomineralization;
* Earth system sciences and global change.
